<img src="./ukb1hbx2.png" style="width:6.375in;height:6.375in" />The
importance of campaigns lies in their ability to
**deliverpersonalized,relevant,and**

**timelymessages**to consumers, fostering meaningful connections and
driving conversions.

Unlike traditional advertising channels, **voiceand** **web**
**campaigns** offer unprecedented levels

of targeting and measurement, allowing businesses to refine their
strategies based on real-time

data and insights.

> 1 **PersonalizedOutreach** A telecommunications company sends

>

Campaigns utilize the **start** **flows** created within the contact
center to craft the customer experience and utilize **automation**
**andagent** **transfer**to assist the customer in real-time if the user
chooses to respond.

Let us learn how to create and manage a campaign.

Navigate to **campaigns**on XO platform.

Select **Voice.**

To begin setting up campaigns, You need to add the **contact**
**lists.**

Navigate to the **List** **Management.**

Select **New** **Contact** **list.**

**Label** the **List** and add the **description.**

The CSV template for creating a call list is available here. Download
it, and Update the list with the contact info in the prescribed format.

And Upload the CSV file.

Map the **Excel** columns to the system fields **below,**

Click **Save**

You can also include a **DNC** list in the same way. If a number from
the contact list is found on the do not contact list, the system will
skip calling that number. This ensures that numbers on the DNC list
**won’t** **be** **contacted** during your campaign.

Now Navigate to **Campaign** **Management**

Click on **New** **Campaign.**

Add a label and description.

Under **Contact** **List**, select the List you want to run the campaign
for

Under **DNC** **list**, Select the list you want to do not contact from
the list.

Set **Priority** Between **1** **5.**

When setting the priority between 1 and 5, consider this: if you are
overseeing multiple campaigns with varying priorities, it's crucial that
the campaign management system can efficiently select and transfer
contacts to the Dialer. To achieve this, the Priority Percentage is

calculated by summing up the priority values of each campaign and
dividing it by the total number of campaigns. This result is multiplied
by 100 to express it as a percentage."

**Priority** **Percentage** **=** **(Sum** **of** **Priority** **Value**
**of** **each** **Campaign** **/** **Numberof** **Campaigns)\*100**

Consider two campaigns with priorities of 5 and 3, respectively. To
allocate percentages:

For Campaign 1 The calculation would be (5 divided by the sum of 5 and
3, which is 8 multiplied by 100, resulting in 62.5%.

For Campaign 2 Similarly, it would be (3 divided by 8 multiplied by
100, leading to 37.5%.

This calculation guarantees an **equitable** **allocation** **of**
**percentages**, reflecting each campaign’s priority. It ensures that
contacts are selected for dialing in accordance with these percentages.

Set the dialing Mode as **Agent** **Less.**

Select the **Start** **Flow** you have created for this campaign.

Toggle the button to activate **answeringmachine** **detection.**

Navigate to **Outreach** **strategy.**

Choose the desired **callerID** for outgoing calls.

In the dialing order section, opt for either **“First** **in** **First**
**out"** or **"Last** **in** **First** **out.”**

Adjust the **maximum** **attemptspercontact**, ranging from **1to**
**100.**

Set the **default** **retry** **period** anywhere from **1to** **1440**
**minutes**before attempting contact again.

Specify the **maximum** **ringtime** between **5to** **120**
**seconds.**

Click on **“Save”** to confirm the settings.

Under the action tab, **initiate** **orhalt** **the** **campaign** and
**monitoritsprogress** using the progress bar.

Let us see a campaign in action.

**Campaigns** on the XO platform can utilize automation and agent
transfer functionalities to address **userqueriesandinteractions**
seamlessly during their engagement with the platform’s campaigns.

**Transcript** –

With **XO** **Platform’s**Web Campaigns, you can effortlessly engage
your website traffic with proactive offers, reminders, or updates
without requiring manual calls or messages.

Using **XO** **Platform’sproactive** **webcampaigns**, businesses can
efficiently streamline targeted offers based on rules and measure their
effectiveness by tracking completion through goals.

Now, let’s dive into creating and managing a **webcampaign.**

First, **navigate** **to** **campaigns** on the XO platform, then
proceed to Campaign Management.

Select Proactive Web, where you can create four types of campaigns:

**Chat:** Engage users with chat-based interactions, providing them with
relevant information.

**Post:** Deliver visually appealing post-based interactions.

**Banner:** Display banner-based interactions anywhere on the website.

**Button:** Provide interactive button-based interactions that are fully
customizable to your needs.

Let’s set up a **chat-basedcampaign:**

Click on **New** **Campaign.**

Select **Chat**.

Under the General Tab, **adda** **label** and **description.**

In the **Layout** **Design** tab, enable the message header **toggle**
**button** to include header text and image with your message.

Click on the **edit** **icon** to add a header and Upload an icon.

Proceed to the **Message** **Tab,** where you can add and format your
message to user.

For instance, let’s promote a 15% discount on Mobiles and Electronics.

You have the option to **format** **the** **message** using the format
menu provided here.

Under **Buttons**, Incorporate interactive buttons and tailor their
functions to your preference.

Customize existing buttons by selecting the "edit" option. For new
buttons, click **“addbutton.”**

**Label** **the** **button** accordingly and assign an action using the
dropdown menu.

Tailor the user experience with these interactive buttons. Choose “Send
to URL" to navigate to a specific webpage, **"Sendto** **Bot"** to
engage with automation AI on the XO platform, or **“Dismiss”** for no
action.

Adjust the button’s background and text colors as desired.

**Customize** **the** **appearances**as desired by utilizing the
prebuilt templates and then save the changes.

Under **Engagement** **Strategy,** customize where and how the campaign
will be displayed.

Navigate to the website, and add the **website** **URL** Or page name
where you want to display this campaign.

Ensure that Kore.ai's Widget SDK is configured on the Website you want
this campaign on

You have the option to **enhance** **customization** **usinglogic**. For
example, if you wish to target users who reach the buy iPhone page only
after visiting the main website, you can incorporate a “Then Condition.”

Note that the Rules available for Or and Then

Furnish the subsequent URL. Consequently, this campaign becomes visible
exclusively to users who have traversed this specific path rather than
to every user.

Following that, you can introduce rules to further tailor the campaigns
using metrics such as **user,** **time** **spent,** **page** **visit**
**count,** **country,** **andcity.**

For instance, you can establish a condition such as a requirement that
the user’s country is India. The campaign will then be displayed
exclusively when the condition is fulfilled.

Additionally, you have the option to **incorporate** **goals** to gauge
the effectiveness of the campaign.

Click on **AddGoal.**

For Instance, Set the page Visited to “add to the cart” page.

This feature allows us to monitor the number of campaigns that
effectively directed customers to the add-to-cart page, providing us
with an overview of campaign success.

**Include** **the** **channels**, such as the Voice Web channel or Chat
Web channel , and configure Engagement Hours between Anytime or
customize them to specify when this offer is accessible.

You can now**initiate** **orpause** this campaign from the **campaign**
**management** **session** and track its progress using the progress
bar.

To illustrate campaigns in action, let’s examine a past campaign titled
“Seasonal Shoe Offer.” As depicted, this campaign is now marked as
“**stopped**,” indicating it’s been halted. The campaign type is
specified as a banner.

Here, we can observe the number of times this campaign was presented to
users under the “**Send**” section and how many users navigated to the
URL set under “**Goals”** in the goals session.

Click on the overflow menu and click on the **edit** icon.

<img src="./m2qkkeyu.png" style="width:0.25in;height:0.25in" />In
the layout design tab, you’ll find the message intended for the
customer, presented as a banner. Let’s adjust the placement to the top.

You can view the post we’ve crafted in the **preview** **pane** on the
left.

Under the engagement strategy, include the website URL, establish rules,
and set a condition under the goal section.

This condition stipulates that after users visit the website via the
banner, they must navigate to a page containing “content details” for
the campaign to confirm the goal as completed.

Save the modifications.

Then, click **“Play”** under the action to commence the campaign.

Next, visit the website to view the **banner.**

Now, proceed to a page featuring “content details.” Navigate back to the
**campaigns** page**.**

Here, you’ll notice that this campaign is active and has been
**executed**once, **achievingthe** **goal** **once.**
